JH-Machine-Learning-project
===========================

This repo contains 2 files: 
1. the report for the John Hopkins Machine Learning course project (.html)
2. the RMarkdown code for it (.Rmd)

Warning: if you want to execute the code, please note that the computation of the predictive model is very resource intensive and is likely to last a long time. Better to start visualizing the .html report
